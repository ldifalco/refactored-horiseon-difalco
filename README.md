# refactored-horiseon-difalco

Welcome to my refactored horiseon project! This site can be used as a homepage for an SEO marketing team/social media management team. The header links direct to the proper content of the site for more information, as well as benefit information for the company. The client requested more semantic HTMl as well as condensed CSS and proper accessibility standards.

For this assignment, Through VSCode I took code already written, and included semantic HTML elements, condensed CSS selectors, and organized both in a way that is logical for one to read and update in the future. Along with this, I also included alt attributes to site images to ensure it meets accessibility standards. I also edited the heading tags to make them in a sequential order in compliance with the client's wishes. The site also now has a clear and concise title element.

There were many challenges and learning experiences during this project, especially with condensing the CSS. Very often I found myself a character away from the correct code and that single character would break the entire page. Specifically with the content section, finding the best possible way to layout the css so it worked together while also independently, is where I found the code most sensitive to breaking the site. I am confident in the changes I made while still mainitaining the integrity of the initial code, but I am excited to see where I can improve in my skills and developing.
